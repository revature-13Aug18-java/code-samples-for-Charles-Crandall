A simple healthcare assistant designed to facilitate very broad diagnosis. Users can register, log in, search symptoms by specific location on the body, receiving a list of possible diagnoses and specialist recommendations for each diagnosis, and once the user has submitted a check, they can review previous results.
Future plans: implement a profile and options to have a new checkup auto-populate the user's age/gender
