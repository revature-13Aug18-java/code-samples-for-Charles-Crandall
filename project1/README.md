Employee Reimbursement System

A mock reimbursement system for Revature employees. It allows users to register, login, and manage their account information. A user may also submit reimbursement requests and view their pending requests, as well as those reviewed by a manager. A manager may do anything that an employee can, but they also have the ability to approve or reject a request, and view which managers reviewed requests. Future plans include manager approval when registering a new manager, and managers being able to view requests by certain criteria.
