RideForce: the Revature Ride Share App

A real life application that we worked together as a group with all 23 batch-mates. The app allows users to sign up as a driver or rider, and find a match for carpooling based on criteria such as location, batch end date, and daily start time. It also allows users to register places that they frequent. The app doesn't handle communication directly, but it provides information and facilitates networking that may not be immediately available to a new Revature Associate.
The project was split into teams, one for DevOps, one for bront end, and three back end teams, one for each service. I worked on the front end with Angular6. We configured the web views to be more user-readable and concise, as well as adding functionality to pages that were not finished, and wrote documentation and testing for a majority of the components, services, and other code. 
Future plans: work refactor userService to communicate with the Auth0 API for proper third party authentication, registration, ande management.

- Auth0 for login authentication
- Jasmine and Karma for testing
- Compodoc for documentation generation
- Google Maps API
