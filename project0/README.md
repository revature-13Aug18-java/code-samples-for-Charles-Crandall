Banking App

A simplistic ATM type application that allowed users to withdraw and deposit money, register their account and sign in, and check their transaction history. Completely command line driven interface, not fully functional. 
The database is set up to register multiple accounts with a single user, and to track transfers between any account, including a dummy account for withdrawls and deposits.
